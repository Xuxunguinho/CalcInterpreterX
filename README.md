# Calculation Interpreter

Simple algorithm for interpretation of calculations. create an application that performs aritmetic operations at run time. Pass a STRING parameter and get the result of its operation.

# This algorithm supports:
  • Order of Precedence of the aritmetic operators  
  
  • Following Operaors :   / , x , % , \ , ^ , - , +     
# This algorithm still does not support:           
  • Result of operations exceeding 999 ^ 5
